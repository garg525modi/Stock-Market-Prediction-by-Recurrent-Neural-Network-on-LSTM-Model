# Stock Market Prediction by Recurrent Neural Network

1. The strength of evaluating stock prices has been an irksome endeavor for a significant part of the researchers and analysts.Investers are significantly enthusiastic about the investigation zone of stock worth desire
1. *A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)* is best approach to predict stock market indices.
### why LSTM?
- LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation that replaces traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network
- With these memory cells, systems can adequately relate recollections and information remote in time, subsequently suit to get a handle on the structure of information progressively over time with high prediction capacity.
### LSTM Architecture

There are countless deep learning frameworks available today.we implments the RNN model by using Keras
